Based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc9-7PBqOC8

- Simple bundler just to demonstrates how webpack bundles your code based on code dependency graph
- There're no advanced features like handling circular dependencies, tree-shaking, etc.
- Usage: run `npm run bundle`, open `output.js` and copy-paste those lines in Browser Console
